# glacier-basin-outburst flood model

This is an glacier outburst flood model combined with a glacier flow model to describe long term changes in outburst floods as the main trunk glacier retreats and glacier catchment geometry changes. To run the full model, the glacier flow model must be run from 'run_glacier_flow_model.m' where the output for each year after retreat will be saved. After the model is run and the all years of glacial retreat have been saved, the outburst flood model can be run from 'Running_NF_with_GC.m'.
